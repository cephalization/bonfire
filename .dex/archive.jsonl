Ensure the terminal can connect without the error 'failed to create serial console pipe'.","result":"Added browser E2E test (e2e/browser-ui.test.ts) using agent-browser CLI for full UI testing of VM creation, start, terminal launch, and command execution. Fixed serial console pipe error by modifying serial.ts to connect to existing pipes instead of creating new ones, and preventing pipe deletion on WebSocket close to allow reconnection.","completed_at":"2026-01-31T03:55:55.190Z","archived_at":"2026-02-01T16:14:50.797Z","metadata":null,"archived_children":[]}

The generateTapName function uses vmId.replace(/-/g, '') which removes all hyphens, but tests expect them to be preserved (e.g., 'vm-123' should become 'tap-bf-vm-123' not 'tap-bf-vm123').
